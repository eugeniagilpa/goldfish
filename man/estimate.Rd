\description{
Estimates parameters for a dynamic network model via maximum likelihood
implementing the iterative Newton-Raphson procedure as describe in
Stadtfeld and Block (2017).
}
\details{
Missing data is imputed during the preprocessing stage.
For network data missing values are replaced by a zero value,
it means that is assuming a not tie/event explicitly.
For attributes missing values are replaced by the mean value,
if missing values are presented during events updates they are replace by
the mean of the attribute in that moment of time.

\section{DyNAM}{


The actor-oriented models that the goldfish package implements have been
called Dynamic Network Actor Models (DyNAMs).
The model is a two-step process. In the first step, the waiting time until
an actor \eqn{i} initiates the next relational event is modeled
(\code{model = "DyNAM"} and \code{subModel = "rate"}) by an exponential
distribution depending on the actor activity rate.
In the second step, the conditional probability of \eqn{i} choosing
\eqn{j} as the event receiver is modeled (\code{model = "DyNAM"} and
\code{subModel = "choice"}) by a multinomial probability distribution
with a linear predictor.
These two-steps are assumed to be conditionally independent given
the process state (Stadtfeld, 2012),
due to this assumption is possible to estimate these components by
different calls of the \code{estimate} function.
}

\section{Waiting times}{


When DyNAM-rate (\code{model = "DyNAM"} and \code{subModel = "rate"}) model
is used to estimate the first step component of the process, or the REM
\code{model = "REM"} model is used.
It is important to add a time intercept to model the waiting times between
events, in this way the algorithm considers the right-censored intervals
in the estimation process.

In the case that the intercept is not included in the formula.
The model reflects the likelihood of an event being the next
in the sequence.
This specification is useful for scenarios where the researcher doesn't have
access to the exact interevent times.
For this ordinal case the likelihood of an event is merely a
multinomial probability (Butts, 2008).
