\arguments{
\item{network, attribute}{Objects upon which the effect should be calculated.
For network effects, this would be either an independent network or the
dependent network by default.
For attribute effects, this should be the attribute name with the indication of the data frame
containing the initial values of nodes attributes (\code{data.frame$attribute}),
see \code{\link{defineNodes}} for details.}

\item{ignoreRep}{Identifies whether the effect recognizes actors to send
additional ties beyond the first to receivers (\code{FALSE} means additional ties
are taken into account). The default value is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{weighted}{Identifies whether the effect relies on the presence or
number of ties (\code{TRUE} means it relies also on the number of ties).
The interpretation depends on the specific effect. The default value is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{window}{Identifies a window length within which changes should apply to events.
The default value is \code{Inf} meaning that no windows are applied to the effect.
Window size can be specified as a number in seconds (i.e. an hour is 3600 seconds),
or as a string stating the number of time units in the format "number unit",
for example "30 seconds", "1 minute", "2 hours", "3 days", "4 weeks", "5 months", or "6 years".
The time units are converted to seconds using their most common lengths in seconds.}

\item{transformFun}{Use this parameter to obtain transformed statistics.
The argument expected is a function or the name of the function to use without quotation marks.}

\item{aggregateFun}{Use this parameter to obtain an aggregated statistics for indirect effects like
\code{tertius} and \code{tertius_diff}.
The argument expected is a function or the name of the function to use without quotation marks.}

\item{type}{Applies only to \code{indegree}, \code{outdegree} and \code{node_trans} in the case of the REM model.
In the default case of \code{type = "alter"}, the effect returns statistics matrices according
to the potential receivers. In the case where \code{type = "ego"}, the effect returns
statistics matrices according to the sender.
This argument does not apply in the case of the DyNAM models: the DyNAM-choice model only considers
the "alter" value, while in the DyNAM-rate, the "ego" value is always to be considered
for these three effects.}
}
\value{
List with the changes to a statistics matrix. It also can have an additional component
  with the cache object if the effect computation requires one.
}
\description{
This page catalogues the list of generic effects that are available in the goldfish package.
\code{ignoreRep}, \code{weighted}, \code{window}, and transformed versions (\code{transformFun})
can be included by adding these arguments.
}
\details{
Note that the use of some effects (combinations) are ill-advised.
For example, using \code{tie(network, ignoreRep = FALSE)},
where the network refers to the dependent network,
will always result in a change statistic of zero,
and thus cannot be used.

\section{Functions}{

\strong{Structural effects (dyads statistics):} These effects cannot be used for the DyNAM-rate model
(\code{model = "DyNAM"} and \code{subModel = "rate"}).
\describe{
  \item{\code{tie}}{Tendency to create an event i->j if the tie i->j exists in a covariate network.
  Parameter \code{weighted} can be set to \code{TRUE} if the weight of j->i is to be taken as a statistic.
  It can be transformed by using \code{transformFun} (This only makes sense with \code{weighted = TRUE}).}
  \item{\code{inertia}}{Usually used as the "intercept" for the choice function,
    'inertia' is the tendency to create an event i->j if the event i->j happened before.
    It can be interpreted as the differential tendency to update existing ties rather than creating new ones.
    Thus, 'inertia' is similar to 'tie', but defined on the network to which the dependent events relate.
    Parameter \code{weighted} can be set to \code{TRUE} if the weight of j->i is to be taken as a statistic.
  It can be transformed by using \code{transformFun} (This only makes sense with \code{weighted = TRUE}).
    \emph{Note:} \code{inertia} can never be used in combination with a \code{ignoreRep = TRUE} parameter
    as this would replace all positive statistics with zeros.}
  \item{\code{recip}}{Reciprocity. Tendency to create an event i->j if one or several j->i happened before.
Parameter \code{weighted} can be set to \code{TRUE} if the weight of j->i is to be taken as a statistic.
  It can be transformed by using \code{transformFun} (This only makes sense with \code{weighted = TRUE}).
  This effect cannot be used for two-mode networks.}
  \item{\code{trans}}{Transitivity. It is the tendency to create an event i->j if it closes
    a two-paths (i->k->j) in the past events \code{network}. It can be transformed by using \code{transformFun}.
    This effect cannot be used for two-mode networks.}
  \item{\code{mixedTrans}}{Transitivity within 2 networks. It is the tendency to create an event i->j if it closes
    a two-paths with events (i->k) in \code{network1} and (k->j) in \code{network2} in the past events.
    It can be transformed by using \code{transformFun}.
    This effect cannot be used for two-mode networks.}
  \item{\code{four}}{It describes the tendency to create an event i->j if there are many possible closures
  of three-paths (i->k<-l->j) in the past events network.}
}
\strong{Structural effects (node statistics):}
\describe{
  \item{\code{indeg}}{In the DyNAM-Rate model: tendency of actor i to send a tie when i has a
    high incoming degree in a covariate network (ego type).
    In the DyNAM-choice model: tendency to create an event i->j when j has a high incoming
    degree in a covariate network ('alter' type).
    In the REM model: tendency to create an event i->j when either i or j has a high incoming
    degree in a covariate network. An argument type allows to choose whether we want to use the
    indegree effect for sender i (\code{type = "ego"}) or for receiver j (\code{type = "alter"}).
  The degree can be transform with \code{transformFun}.}
  \item{\code{outdeg}}{In the DyNAM-Rate model: tendency of actor i to send a tie when i has a
    high outgoing degree in a covariate network (ego type).
    In the DyNAM-choice model: tendency to create an event i->j when j has a high outgoing
    degree in a covariate network ('alter' type).
    In the REM model: tendency to create an event i->j when either i or j has a high outgoing
    degree in a covariate network. An argument type allows to choose whether we want to use the
    outdegree effect for sender i (\code{type = "ego"}) or for receiver j (\code{type = "alter"}).
  The degree can be transform with \code{transformFun}.}
  \item{\code{node_trans}}{Embeddedness in transitive structures as a source node.
   It is the tendency of actor i to send a tie when there are transitive triangles where
   i is the source (i->k->j<-i) that are closed. The degree can be transform with \code{transformFun}.}
}
\strong{Attribute effects:}
\describe{
  \item{\code{ego}}{In the DyNAM-rate is the tendency of actors to be more active when
  they score high on \code{attribute}. For REM is the tendency of an event i->j when i has a high attribute.
  This effects cannot be used for the DyNAM-choice model
  (\code{model = "DyNAM"} and \code{subModel = "choice"})}
  \item{\code{alter}}{The tendency to create an event i->j when j has a high \code{attribute}.
  These effects cannot be used for the DyNAM-rate model
  (\code{model = "DyNAM"} and \code{subModel = "rate"})}
  \item{\code{same}}{Homophily (same value). The tendency of an event i->j to happen
  if actors i and j have the same attribute. This effect cannot be used for two-mode networks
  and for the DyNAM-rate model
  (\code{model = "DyNAM"} and \code{subModel = "rate"})}
  \item{\code{sim}}{Homophily (similar value). The tendency to create an event i->j where both
  actors have similar \code{attribute} values (low absolute differences regarding
  \code{attribute} if \code{transformFun = abs}).
  This effect cannot be used for two-mode networks and neither for the DyNAM-rate model
  (\code{model = "DyNAM"} and \code{subModel = "rate"})}
  \item{\code{diff}}{Heterophily. The tendency to create an event i->j where both actors have
  different \code{attribute} values (high absolute differences regarding \code{attribute} if
  \code{transformFun = abs}).
  This effect cannot be used for two-mode networks and neither for the DyNAM-rate model
  (\code{model = "DyNAM"} and \code{subModel = "rate"})}
}
\strong{Structural + attribute effects (node or dyads statistics):}
\describe{
  \item{\code{tertius}}{For DyNAM-choice and REM is the tendency to create an event i->j when
  j has a high aggregate (\code{aggregateFun}) value of its in-neighbors
  (all k with \code{network[k, j] > 0}).
  For DyNAM-rate is the tendency of actors to be more active when they have a high aggregate
  value of their in-neighbors. \emph{Note:} When the node does not have in-neighbors,
  the average of the aggregate values of nodes is used for the node.
  }
  \item{\code{tertius_diff}}{The tendency to create an event i->j when i has a similar value as
  j aggregate (\code{aggregateFun}) value of its in-neighbors (all k with \code{network[k, j] > 0}.
   \emph{Note:} When the node j does not have in-neighbors, the average of the similarities
   computed for the pairs i, k when k has in-neighbors is used for the node.
